# Gathering & Analyzing MFL10s Draft Only Best Ball League Data from 2013-2014

### Background
Over the past few years, draft-only, best ball type fantasy football leagues have become quite popular among more serious players.  myfantasyleague.com was the first to offer these leagues, referred to as "MFL10s" because of the low $10 entry.  The low entry fee combined with the draft-only, best ball format makes it easy for one to enter tens (and sometimes hundreds) of leagues to diversify away much of the variance associated with fantasy league results while removing the burden of ongoing management after the draft.  

### Objective
As the popularity of MFL10s has grown, so has discussion about the "optimal" draft strategy.  In reading some articles on the subject, I had two issues:  

1. **No Data**: The data used in these analyses is not made available to the reader to verify the results or analyze further.  

2. **Wrong Metrics**: The analyses tended to focus on the wrong metrics for evaluating success, such as average points scored or average place.  Given that the cash prize pool for the $10 leagues is entirely concentrated in 1st place, the appropriate measure of success if **probability of winning the league**, or turning the probability into **expected value**.
